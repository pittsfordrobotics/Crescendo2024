# Crescendo2024

This is FRC Team 3181 (Pittsford Panthers)'s code for the 2024 FIRST® Robotics Competition, CRESCENDO℠.

Inside are subsystems for:
* the swerve drive, implemented using YAGSL, with support for:
  * teleoperated mode
  * autonomous commands (not tested yet but it works in sim so OF COURSE it'll work in real life);
* the shooter (there are still some unresolved issues with SPARK Flexes and Vortices);
* the end effectors (current code is deprecated).

Currently, there are several in-development features in branches; these are to be merged soon. There is also some 
outdated code in the master branch; these are to be removed once said merging occurs.
